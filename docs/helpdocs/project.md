# Manage Projects

[Projects](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/concepts/projects) act as permission and replication boundaries in Massdriver.

A project can encompass many environments (permanent or ephemeral) and manages the parity across those environments.

## Commands

- `get`: Retrieve project details and configuration
- `list`: List all projects in your organization
