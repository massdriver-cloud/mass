# Artifact Definitions

[Artifact Definitions](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/concepts/artifacts) define the schema and behavior of artifacts in Massdriver.

Artifact definitions are used to:
- Define the schema for artifact data
- Specify how artifacts are created and managed
- Control how artifacts are displayed in the UI
- Define connections between artifacts
