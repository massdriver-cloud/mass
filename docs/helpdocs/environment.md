# Manage Environments

[Environments](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/concepts/environments) are the workspaces that bundles will be deployed to.

Environments can be modeled by application stage (production, staging, development), by region (prod-usw, prod-eu), and even ephemerally per developer (alice-dev, bob-dev).
