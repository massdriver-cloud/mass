Massdriver CLI

## Code layout

* `internal/api` - Massdriver GraphQL API SDK
* `internal/commands` - High-level tasks performed by the CLI. UI & I/O interactions should happen from here.

## API Generate

GraphQL code is mostly autogenerated using genqlient.

You will need a copy of the Massdriver GraphQL schema. A version is vendored in `internal/api`.

Queries can be copy/pasted from the [GraphQL playground](https://api.massdriver.cloud/api/graphiql).

**NOTE:** Not all queries are allowlisted for service account access at this time. If you receive an unauthorized response for a query that worked in the playground, that API is considered unstable and not enabled for public access.

```shell
make generate
```

## CLI

```
mass app # application config & deploy
mass infra # infrastructure config & deploy
